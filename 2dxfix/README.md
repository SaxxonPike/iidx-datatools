# 2dxfix

This are some tools I made to search for bad audio files in .2dx archives, then convert the archive to the correct audio format and make an .s3p archive from the new audio.
This is particularly important starting with CB because the audio engine changed and is a lot more sensitive to audio files that aren't 44.1KHz stereo.

2dx_extract (https://github.com/iDestyKK/2dx_extract) is used as part of the process because why not.
